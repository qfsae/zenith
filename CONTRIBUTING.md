# Contributing to Zenith

Starting in the Q21 season, the electrical team has decided to implement a code review process to ensure that the master branch of this repository has the latest working code that can run on the car. When starting a new contribution to the repository, please follow the steps given below:

1. BEFORE writing any code or making commits, checkout a working branch for yourself from master branch. In command line git, this is done by doing `git checkout -b yourBranchName`.

2. Once you have finished your work and would like to submit your code for review, commit your latest changes using `git add` and `git commit`. Once everything is committed you can push to the main repository with the command `git push -u origin yourBranchName`. You will be prompted for your credentials to complete the operation.

3. Follow the instructions on the GitHub documentation to [Open a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

4. Assign another team member for review and merge the pull request upon approval!
