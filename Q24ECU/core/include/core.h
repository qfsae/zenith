 * 
 * The Core's main function is to initialize and maintain the acceleration throttle control (ATC)
 * tasks including the ATC task itself and the Software Differential Control (SDC) task.

    Upon returning to the core task, the system state will be checked against the error state before the
    next state starts. States are looping, ie the Ready To Drive state returns to the idle state.
