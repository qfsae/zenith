# CAN Abstraction Layer (CAL)

Please see folder CAL3.  Declarations and structures are contained within CAL3/include/cal.hpp, while the update methods are contained within CAL3/src/cal.cpp

The Arduino project contained within the CAL3 folder also acts as an example project on how one might use CAL in order to update a specific peice of data and use it.



This folder contains CAL, the QFSAE custom library for interacting with CAN bus.
The file `include/cal.h` contains the C++ abstract class declaration, which
specifies the library's interface.
