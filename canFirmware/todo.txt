Todo:

Assign address and buffIndex to each message from ECU.
Uncomment that.

For each datat point in if statement, manipulate the data before assignment. 
Currently, its only storing the hex of the incoming data as an unsigned char, so 
you havt to cnage that too depending on what type of manipulated data you are 
assigning.

Confused about status field, more work has to be done for those parameters.
